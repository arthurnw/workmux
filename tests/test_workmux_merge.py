    """Verifies merge works correctly in a bare repo with linked worktrees setup.

    This tests the scenario where:
    1. The repository is a bare repo (e.g., .bare directory)
    2. All branches including main are in linked worktrees
    3. The worktree being merged has a name that sorts alphabetically before main

    This is a regression test for a bug where `git worktree prune` would fail
    with "No such file or directory" because get_main_worktree_root() returned
    a non-existent worktree path.

    The bug occurs because:
    1. git worktree list returns worktrees sorted by path
    2. When all worktrees are siblings (same directory level), they sort alphabetically
    3. "add-feature" < "main", so the feature worktree is listed first
    4. get_main_worktree_root() returns the first non-bare worktree
    5. After the feature worktree is renamed to trash, that path no longer exists
    6. prune_worktrees() tries to run git from that non-existent path and fails
