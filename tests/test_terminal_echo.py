    Ensures that when workmux sets up a pane with a command (using the handshake),
    it restores terminal echo before exec-ing the shell.

    The bug: PaneHandshake runs `stty -echo` before signaling readiness, then
    execs into the shell without restoring echo. Bash doesn't auto-fix this
    (unlike zsh's ZLE), leaving typed input invisible.

    The fix: Add `stty echo` before the exec.
